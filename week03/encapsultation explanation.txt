Encapsulation means a principle of enclosing some part of the class code for other parts of the program to block the Access to this part of the code directly.
The purpose of that principle is of protect the integrity and Fidelity of some part of a code class, and that is a Benefit because it ensures that the data don't 
be affected directly instead have the control of that from only the methods of behavior without modifying the private part of the class.
Like in the following example we are trying to set the values of some private variables that are encapsulated with another method, the Benefit here is that we can 
set this values with only one method with out the necessity of use the private reference directly. It Will very useful for the companies to save more time to 
spend with another projects and give the users or programetors a "control bar" to have Access this encapsulated values with only one statement.


public class Reference {
    private string _book;
    private int _chapter;
    private int _verse;
    private int _endVerse;

    public Reference(string book, int chapter, int verse) {
        _book = book;
        _chapter = chapter;
        _verse = verse;
        _endVerse = verse; // Default to a single verse
    }
}
